# AVRprograming
How to write native C code without any of the Arduino IDE overhead and flash it directly to your microcontroller (this case an Arduino Uno). In summary, this code is a basic example on how to go deep into the world of embedded microcontrollers and learn how bitmasks work, how to set and unset flags on a register, and use them all to do the Blink LED in C.
